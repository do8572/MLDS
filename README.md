## 1. Reproducibility challenge

### 1.1. Topics

* One-shot learning
* Contrastive learning
* Reinforcement learning (RL)
* Generalization to unseen data
* Active learning
* NLP
* CV
* Graph neural networks
* NN prunning

### 1.2. Papers

We should paste articles we read here, mark which ones we would be interested in reproducing (Domen, David fields) and why - easy to implement, we implemented something similar to the topic Known = (+: both, o: one, -: neither), usable (to topic might be really usable in the future) (+: probably, o: maybe, -: prob. not).
